{"texts": ["Was Re:Creators originally planned to feature fictional works that actually exist in the real world?", "The basic premise of the anime Re:Creators is that when someone writes a book or scriptwrites a video game or something, they create an actual world where the events of the book/game/etc actually happen. Then, at the beginning of the show, some of the characters from those created worlds get transported into the \"show world\" (the world in which the main character [Souta] lives and in which the created worlds are works of fiction) by a Plot Device (the princess).\n\nAll of the created worlds are works of fiction that exist in the show world, but do not exist in the \"real world\" (the world in which you and I live), like Avalken of Reminiscence and Vogelchevalier and Magical Slayer Mamika.\n\nI have noticed talk of a rumor (see e.g. here) that the created worlds were originally planned to be works of fiction that do exist in the real world, but that this plan fell through for one reason or another.\n\nWhat is the source of this rumor, and how veracious is it? It sounds very truthy, almost to the point that I have to wonder if the source is some random guy who thought it would be cool if it actually played out that way and so originated the rumor."], "tags": ["re-creators", "phd"]}
{"texts": ["What is the origin of the face fault?", "In many anime, when characters are surprised or seen to do something stupid, the other characters will sometimes fall or keel over on their faces in some comical positions with their legs in the air.

{"texts": ["Where and how was Diavolo hiding where he was after the body swaps of Silver Chariot Requiem?", "In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, I don't understand the rules of the body/soul swap and where Diavolo was hiding during the soul swapping shenanigans of Silver Chariot Requiem.\n\nWas Diavolo apparently hiding inside King Crimson who was attached as a summonable stand of Trish (along with Spice Girl)? If so this raises many other questions for me of such as\n\nWhy is it that King Crimson attached to Trish? Could King Crimson have happened have been attached to Trish, but could've been attached to anyone else as well? I would have assumed the stand to have been attached to the mind/soul as has been the case for the other swaps.\n\nWhy is Diavolo's &quot;soul&quot; inside King Crimson, a stand rather than a regular physical body like the other swaps (albeit Polnaroff is in a turtle transport MacGuffin that has stand...?)\n\nWhy didn't other souls get put into stands e.g. Giorno is inside Foo Fighters the airplane stand? My memory is foggy but I feel the question could be asked about how chaotic you want to make your swaps do every bullet in Sex Pistols count of a potential body then?\n\n\nOr is it the case that split personality thing made it so Trish and Diavolo's mind/soul was in the Mista physical body she was inhabiting, and that King Crimson just has an innate perk of letting Diavolo inhabit it?"], "tags": ["jojos-bizarre-adventure"]}
