The two new things which yesterday changed about my phone are: I updated my phone and I started playing games through facebook. I've reset my phone's notification settings and at least one of the games does also send notifications when something happens. The other one doesn't, but I haven't noticed any correlation between the virbations and something happening in the game.\n\nSmart Alert is turned off.\n\nSomething which might be irrelevant: permissions for certain apps (Whatsapp and Snapchat) got reset, either after the update or after resetting notification settings. \n\nWhat causes these vibrations without notifications?\nIs there any way to check what causes a vibration?"], "tags": ["samsung", "updates", "notifications", "vibration", "samsung-galaxy-a8-2018"]}
