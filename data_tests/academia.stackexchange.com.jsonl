{"texts": ["Reasonable to exclude a specific professor from a thesis defense for personal reasons?", "When I started my Master's program, my supervisor was Professor X. However, I had to leave their group after a few months, partly because we didn't get along, but also because the research topic wasn't a good fit.\nPresently, my supervisor is Professor Y (who is awesome, and with whom I performed research work that really interested me). Now, I am getting ready to defend my thesis and need to select professors for the defense committee.\nIt so happens that my current thesis research deals tangentially with Professor X's research focus from about 5 years ago (and by the way, there aren't many professors whose research directly relates to my thesis). Under normal circumstances, Professor X would have been a decent choice for my defense committee.\nHere is where I need a gut-check: I personally do not want Professor X on my defense committee. It is unlikely that they would try to sabotage my defense, but I have always found it distressing to be in Professor X's presence. Yes, I could grin and bear it, but I would simply rather not do that. Is it reasonable to request that Professor X be excluded?"], "tags": ["masters", "thesis-committee", "defense"]}

I have one in mind from my personal university and 2 from other universities (with whom I have done extensive research with).\nThe one prof I plan to ask for an LOR from my personal university has not taught me in any class but I have done good amount of research with them (6-8 months). (This person has a professor grade with a doctorate and an extensive research portfolio and leads their own lab.)\nI have another prof who has taught me several classes and I have done some research with them but have recently come in bad terms and I fear they might give me negative reviews. So I am quite skeptical of asking them now. (This person has a assistant-professor grade and no doctorate.)\nAnother reason why I ask this is because I am not a department topper and my courses at my university are quite mediocre, no stress upon lab components and no major project for any course. I even have mediocre attendance.\nQuestion:\nIs it okay if all 3 of my Letter writers did not teach me any class during my university tenure? Will it hamper my chances in any way?"], "tags": ["phd", "graduate-admissions", "recommendation-letter", "professors", "undergraduate"]}
{"texts": ["Legality of collecting/distributing a dataset of screenshots of websites", "I'm doing a research project where I want to collect thousands of screenshots of different websites, for training/testing of image models.
